Package SunPinyin for Mac OS X release
======================================

SunPinyin for Mac OS X has been updated to support automatic
self-update and automatic data files (lm_sg.t3g, pydict_sc.bin)
fetching.

1. After you update data files (../../../data/*.t3g.{be,le},
*.bin.{be.le}), run genplist.py to generate a plist for these,
then upload the output to somewhere we can access publicly.

2. After SunPinyin is updated, run package.py to generate the
installer package, create zip archive, Sparkle appcast. Then
upload them according to the output of package.py.
