How to install data files for sunpinyin
=======================================

Get `lm_sc.t3g.arpa.tar.bz2' and `dict.utf8.tar.bz2' from [1],
unpack them into some directory, and issue the following command in that
directory:

	make -f /path/to/SLM.mk data_bin

Then copy generated `lm_sc.t3g' and `pydict3_sc.bin' to sunpinyin's data
directory, usually /usr/share/sunpinyin/, and you are done.
