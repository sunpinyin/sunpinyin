             Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
             Modifications made by that Contributor.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
     3.1. Availability of Source Code.
 .
     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
     available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
     Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
     the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
     License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
     Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
     inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
     as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
     form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
     used for software exchange.
 .
     3.2. Modifications.
 .
     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You

     You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
     License.
 .
     3.3. Required Notices.
 .
     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
     not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
     contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
     or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
     the Initial Developer.
 .
     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
 .
     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
     of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
     choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
     Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
     and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
     You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
     hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
     Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
     such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
     liability terms You offer.
 .
     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 .
     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
     under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
     Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
     the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
     Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
     must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
     this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
     by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
     such terms You offer.
 .
     3.6. Larger Works.
 .
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
     other code not governed by the terms of this License and
     distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
     You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
     for the Covered Software.
 .
 4. Versions of the License.
 .
     4.1. New Versions.
 .
     Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
     publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
     time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
     Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
     steward has the right to modify this License.
 .
     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
 .
     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
     License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
     If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
     Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
     available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
     distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
     of the version of the License under which You originally received
     the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
     distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
     the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
     the license steward.
 .
     4.3. Modified Versions.
 .
     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
     and remove any references to the name of the license steward
     (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
     (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
     differ from this License.
 .
 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
     SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
     COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
     INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
     WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
     DISCLAIMER.
 .
 6. TERMINATION.
 .
     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
     the termination of this License shall survive.
 .
     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
     the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
     the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
     the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
     under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
     notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
     at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
     such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
     Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
     or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
 .
     6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
 .
 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
     LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
     STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
     INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
     APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
     NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
     APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
     defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
     computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
     C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
     documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
     (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
     C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
     U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
     rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
     lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
     provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
     under this License.
 .
 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
     
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
     by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
     within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
     if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
     conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
     License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
     in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
     within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
     for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
     reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
     United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
     of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
     provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
     against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
     that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
     States export administration regulations (and the export control
     laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
     distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
 .
 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
     
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
     indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
     and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
     distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
     herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
     of liability.
 .

     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
     License.
  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains

     declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic
     works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the

     work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
     choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
     are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to

     and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
     means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
     digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
     way that members of the public may access these Works from a place

     electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
     steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
     were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
     marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
     a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
     in Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
       i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
          in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
          compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
          reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
          exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
          which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
          compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
          the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
          by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
          collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
          the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
          administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
          any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
     the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
     to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
     measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
     the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
     incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms
     of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
     You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
     the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
     required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
     the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
     jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
     contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
     Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
     License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
     mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
     you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
     mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
     comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
     the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
     License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
     Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer
     to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
     every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute
     or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
     Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures
     on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies
     to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
     require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
     subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
     means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
     if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
     such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
     information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
     in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
     Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
     credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
     appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
     prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
     avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
     take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
     prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
     agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
     exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
     right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
     exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make
     Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
     License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
     and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
     Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
     of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July
     24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
     relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
     enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
     law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
     License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.
